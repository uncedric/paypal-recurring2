# This class helps to create PayPal recurring subscriptions through the
# PayPal API.
#
# To learn how to integrate it with your application, have a look at unit
# tests in the test folder and the provided example using express.js
#
# Note that you need to pass a valid set of PayPal API username, password & signature
# to the class constructor for the class to work.
